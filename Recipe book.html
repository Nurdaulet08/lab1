        <p><strong class="step">Step 1:</strong> First, prepare all the ingredients you need. Any apples are suitable, but sweet and sour is better. If you take acidic ones, you can increase the amount of sugar. If sweet, on the contrary, reduce.
</p>
        <p><strong class="step">Step 2:</strong>In a separate bowl, grind the eggs with sugar and salt until smooth. We don't need fluffy foam, so you don't need to whip.
    </p>
        <p><strong class="step">Step 3:</strong>Pour soda into kefir and mix. Keep in mind that the mass may increase in volume due to a chemical reaction, so pour the kefir into a large glass in advance.
    </p>
        <p><strong class="step">Step 4:</strong>Pour the kefir into the egg mixture and stir until smooth.
    </p>
        <p><strong class="step">Step 5:</strong>Sift the wheat flour directly into the dough. To do this, take a small sieve so that the flour does not spray over the table surface.
    </p>
        <p><strong class="step">Step 6:</strong>Stir the dough well so that there are no lumps in it. You can do this with a spoon, whisk, fork, or mixer.
    </p>
        <p><strong class="step">Step 7:</strong>Wash the apples well, dry them, remove the cores and cut them into small cubes. Since my apples are thin and delicate, I don’t peel them off — you can peel the apples before slicing.
    </p>
        <p><strong class="step">Step 8:</strong>Add apples to dough and stir. By the way, you can grate the apples instead of slicing, then the pancakes will turn out to be more tender.
    </p>
        <p><strong class="step">Step 9:</strong>Preheat a frying pan with vegetable oil and fry the pancakes on each side for 2-3 minutes.
